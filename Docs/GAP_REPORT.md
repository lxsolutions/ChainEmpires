# Chain Empires Alpha: GAP Report

## Current State Analysis

### Project Structure
- ✅ Repository cloned successfully to `/workspace/ChainEmpires`
- ✅ Basic Unity project structure exists (Assets/, Library/)
- ❌ Missing proper assembly definition boundaries for Client, Shared, Server, Content
- ❌ No separate Server or Backend directories established

### Core Systems Analysis
**GameManager.cs**: Basic state management implemented
**ResourceManager.cs**: Resource types, generation, consumption logic present
**BuildingManager.cs**: Building construction/upgrade system with object pooling
**UnitManager.cs**: Unit stats, training, movement, attack logic
**CombatManager.cs**: Simple battle resolution between unit groups

### Missing Components for Alpha Prototype
1. **Skirmish Scene Foundation**
   - ❌ Skirmish_Alpha.unity scene not created (NOW ADDED)
   - ❌ Player base setup missing
   - ❌ Enemy AI base implementation needed

2. **Building Types**
   - ✅ BuildingManager exists but needs specific building types:
     - ❌ Harvester (Ore collection)
     - ❌ Barracks (Unit production)
     - ❌ Wall (Defense structure)

3. **Resource System**
   - ✅ ResourceManager exists
   - ❌ Need to configure 2 resource types: Ore, Energy

4. **Units Configuration**
   - ✅ UnitManager exists but needs specific unit types:
     - ❌ Melee unit configuration
     - ❌ Ranged unit configuration

5. **AI Enemy Base**
   - ❌ Simple AI enemy base implementation needed
   - ❌ Basic state machine for enemy behavior

6. **Telemetry System**
   - ❌ No telemetry system implemented
   - ❌ Need wrapper over Unity Analytics stub or custom HTTP to /telemetry

7. **Networking Integration**
   - ❌ Mirror package not integrated
   - ❌ Headless server build profile needed
   - ❌ Authority setup for combat/resource ticks

8. **Build Configuration**
   - ✅ Unity project exists but needs update:
     - ❌ Update to Unity 2023 LTS from current version (unknown)
     - ❌ Add Android/iOS/Windows build configurations

9. **Web3 Features Disabling**
   - ❌ Need to disable Web3 features and implement chain abstraction
   - ❌ Set IsWeb3Enabled = false globally

### Dependencies Analysis
- ✅ Git repository with proper structure exists
- ✅ CI/CD workflows configured in .github/workflows
- ❌ Unity 2021.3.8f1 currently configured (need to update to 2023 LTS)
- ❌ Mirror package needed for networking integration

### Version Control Status
- ✅ Working on main branch
- ✅ Existing .git repository with proper structure
- ✅ CI/CD workflows already configured in .github/workflows

## Implementation Plan

1. **Project Setup Completion**
   - Create assembly definition files (Client, Shared, Server, Content)
   - Establish Packages/ directory for Unity packages
   - Update build configuration to Unity 2023 LTS
   - Add EditorConfig and IDE settings

2. **Core Loop Prototype Implementation**
   - Complete Skirmish_Alpha.unity scene setup
   - Implement missing building types (Harvester, Barracks, Wall)
   - Configure existing units for melee/ranged combat
   - Set up basic AI enemy base with simple state machine
   - Implement telemetry system wrapper

3. **Networking Integration**
   - Integrate Mirror package
   - Create headless server build profile
   - Establish authority over combat/resource ticks
   - Implement deterministic RNG util

4. **Web3 Disabling & Chain Abstraction**
   - Disable all Web3 features (set IsWeb3Enabled = false)
   - Implement IChainService interface with mock implementation
   - Scaffold chain adapters for future integration

## Next Steps

1. Complete the project setup tasks outlined above
2. Begin implementing core loop prototype components
3. Set up version control and CI/CD pipelines for continuous integration
4. Establish regular progress tracking and documentation updates
