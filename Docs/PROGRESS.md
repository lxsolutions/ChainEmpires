## Week 1: Project Setup & Core Loop Foundation

### Day 1-2: Repository Audit and GAP Analysis
- ✅ Cloned repository to `/workspace/ChainEmpires`
- ✅ Generated comprehensive GAP REPORT documenting current state
- ✅ Analyzed existing codebase components (GameManager, ResourceManager, etc.)
- ❌ Identified missing components for alpha prototype

### Day 3: Project Structure Organization
- ✅ Created assembly definition files (Client.asmdef, Shared.asmdef, Content.asmdef)
- ✅ Established Server and Backend directories with asmdefs
- ✅ Added EditorConfig and IDE settings (.idea, .vscode)
- ✅ Updated README.md to reflect fun-first alpha focus

### Day 4: Skirmish Scene Foundation
- ✅ Created Skirmish_Alpha.unity scene file
- ❌ Player base setup (pending Unity access)
- ❌ Enemy AI base implementation (pending Unity access)

### Day 5: Core Systems Configuration
- ❌ Building types configuration (Harvester, Barracks, Wall) - pending Unity
- ❌ Unit types configuration (Melee, Ranged) - pending Unity
- ❌ Resource system setup (Ore, Energy) - pending Unity

### Day 6: Networking and Chain Abstraction
- ❌ Mirror package integration - pending Unity access
- ✅ Created IChainService interface scaffold
- ✅ Disabled Web3 features globally (IsWeb3Enabled = false)
