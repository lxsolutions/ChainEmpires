# Chain Empires

A 3rd-person strategy/leveling-up game with base building, resource management, multiplayer interactions in a shared persistent world, turn-based/asynchronous gameplay optimized for mobile, and deep integration of cryptocurrency and NFTs for a play-to-earn (P2E) model.

## Game Concept Overview

Chain Empires blends RTS strategy, RPG leveling, tower defense waves, and turn-based PvP/PvE interactions in a massive shared persistent universe. Players progress through eras (Stone Age → Medieval → Industrial → Space Age → Galactic), gathering resources, building structures, producing units, researching technologies, and expanding their empire.

## Key Features

- **Mobile Optimization**: Asynchronous/turn-based mechanics with real-time timers
- **3rd-Person Perspective**: Overhead strategy view with zoom to 3rd-person camera for unit control
- **Shared World**: Dynamic realms based on player progression levels with innovative cross-realm interactions
- **Resource Management**: Automated harvesters, expeditions, conquests, and player trades
- **Player Interactions**: PvP combat, PvE challenges, alliances, and cooperative events
- **Web3 Integration**: NFT assets (land plots, units, buildings), in-game cryptocurrency, decentralized governance

## Technical Stack

- **Engine**: Unity (C#)
- **Multiplayer**: Photon or Mirror for asynchronous server-authoritative networking
- **Blockchain**: Solana Unity SDK or Moralis for Web3 features
- **Database**: Firebase for off-chain data, Solana for on-chain assets
