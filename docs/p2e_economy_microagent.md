# P2E Economy Microagent for Chain Empires

## Overview
Refine play-to-earn with "Chain Crystals" token and NFTs: Optional but rewarding, anti-P2W focus. Use Solana for on-chain; simulate off-chain for tests.

## Key Features
- **Token Economy**: Earn via dailies (logins = 5-20 tokens), quests (raid boss = 50), staking (yield 5% APY on bases). Spend: Timers, cosmetics, governance.
- **NFT Utility**: Breeding/evolution with rarity RNG; dynamic traits (e.g., unit NFTs "age" over seasons, gaining perks or degrading if neglected).
- **Innovations**:
  - **Eco-Simulation**: Autonomous sims (e.g., 1000 player sessions) to balance inflation (cap supply via burns).
  - **Cross-Game Ties**: Placeholder for interop (e.g., import NFTs from partner games via metadata).
  - **Risk-Reward Events**: Global lotteries (stake tokens for rare NFTs); community vaults for alliance-shared yields.
  - **Anti-Exploit**: On-chain validators for cheats; free grind multipliers (e.g., +10% earnings after 7-day streak).

## Implementation
- Tie to Web3Manager: Functions for mint/earn/spend; use testing microagent for balance sims.
- Autonomy Tip: If economy feels imbalanced, use think to iterate models (e.g., adjust yields via code_execution math sims).
