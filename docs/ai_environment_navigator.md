# AI Environment Navigator for Chain Empires

## Overview
Manage AI-driven world elements: Barbarians, waves, hazards. Make interactive (diplomacy, alliances) and adaptive for engagement.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Ecosystems**: AI factions (barbarians) with states: Neutral, Aggressive, Allied. Diplomacy: Trade resources for protection (e.g., pay 100 minerals for temp alliance).
- **Tower Defense Waves**: Inspired by Mineralz Evolution. Waves spawn periodically; adaptive â€“ if players use archers often, waves gain shields.
  - Wave Logic: Use ScriptableObjects for wave templates (enemy types, paths). Scale by realm (stone age: basic mobs; galactic: aliens).
- **Environmental Hazards**: Random events (e.g., storms damage buildings unless sheltered). Players interact collectively (e.g., alliance ritual to stop event).
- **Intelligent AI**: Simple "learning" via stats: Track global player strategies (e.g., % militaristic), adjust (e.g., more diplomats if peaceful meta).
- **Innovative Twists**:
  - **Echo Realms**: Parallel sim where units farm risk-free; sync rewards but with "echo tax" (10% loss).
  - **Narrative Branches**: Choices (e.g., exploit environment) spawn events (e.g., rebellion if over-mined).
  - **Community Events**: Poll-based (in-game UI) for world changes; AI adapts to votes.

## Implementation in AIEnvironmentManager.cs
- Use Unity's NavMesh for AI pathing.
- Wave System: Coroutine for spawning; use ML-Agents-like logic for adaptation (simple counters, no full ML).
- Diplomacy: State machine per faction; UI for negotiations.
- Integration: Hook into WorldMapManager for spawns, UnitManager for combats.

Test: Simulate waves offline; ensure mobile perf (<10% CPU during waves).
