# Testing and QA Microagent for Chain Empires

## Overview
Implement comprehensive testing for reliability: Unit tests for managers, integration for multiplayer/Web3, playtests for mobile perf. Use Unity Test Framework; automate via self-improvement cycles.

## Key Features
- **Unit/Integration Tests**: ScriptableObjects for scenarios (e.g., resource consumption, unit leveling). Test edge cases: Low resources, offline syncs, cross-realm fairness.
- **Playtest Sims**: Automated bots simulate players (e.g., 50-unit battles, wave defenses); measure FPS/battery on Device Simulator.
- **Innovations**:
  - **Adaptive Testing**: If a test fails, use think to brainstorm fixes, then refactor and re-run.
  - **P2E Balance Sims**: Model economy (e.g., token earnings over 100 sessions); adjust for anti-P2W (ensure free players reach 80% of paid progression).
  - **Crash Analytics**: Mock Firebase Analytics for error tracking; auto-log to grok-progress-hub.md.
  - **Community Sim**: Fake player polls/votes to test meta-evolution.

## Implementation
- Setup: Add NUnit via Package Manager; create /Tests/ folder.
- Run: Use code_execution or Unity Editor CLI for batches; aim for 90% coverage.
- Autonomy Tip: After steps, auto-run tests; if <85% pass, iterate fixes before proceeding.
