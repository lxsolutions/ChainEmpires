# Chain Empires GAP REPORT

## Current State Analysis

### Project Structure
- **Repository**: Cloned successfully to `/workspace/ChainEmpires`
- **Branch**: Working on `main` branch
- **Unity Version**: Currently using Unity 2021.3.8f1 (CI config)
- **Project Files**:
  - Assets directory with Scripts, UI, Store folders
  - Editor scripts for building and testing
  - .github workflows for CI/CD

### Existing Implementation

#### Core Systems
✅ **GameManager**: Implemented with basic state management
✅ **ResourceManager**: Resource types (Minerals, Energy, etc.), generation, consumption logic
✅ **BuildingManager**: Building types, construction/upgrade system, object pooling
✅ **UnitManager**: Unit types, stats, training, leveling, movement, attack logic
✅ **CombatManager**: Basic battle resolution between unit groups

#### AI Systems
✅ **EnemyAI**: Simple enemy behavior with target finding, movement, and attack logic
✅ **EnemyManager**: Enemy spawning framework (basic)

#### Web3 Integration
⚠️ **Web3Integration**: Solana SDK integration exists but needs to be disabled/abstracted

### Missing Components for Core Loop Prototype

#### Scenes
❌ **Skirmish Scene**: No dedicated scene for the 5-minute loop prototype
- Need: Create `Assets/Scenes/Skirmish_Alpha.unity`

#### Buildings (Required Types)
✅ **TownHall** - exists in BuildingManager
⚠️ **Harvester** - needs to be implemented or mapped from existing types
⚠️ **Barracks** - needs to be implemented or mapped from existing types
❌ **Wall** - not implemented

#### Resources (Required Types)
✅ **Ore** - exists as Minerals in ResourceManager
✅ **Energy** - exists in ResourceManager

#### Units (Required Types)
✅ **Melee Unit** - can use Warrior or MeleeChampion from UnitManager
⚠️ **Ranged Unit** - can use Archer or RangedChampion from UnitManager

#### Enemy AI Base
❌ **AI Base**: No dedicated enemy base implementation for raids
- Need: Create simple AI-controlled base with basic defense

#### Telemetry System
❌ **Telemetry Events**: No telemetry system implemented
- Need: Basic HTTP telemetry sender or Unity Analytics wrapper

### Infrastructure Needs

#### Networking
❌ **Mirror Integration**: Not yet integrated for server-authoritative networking
- Need: Add Mirror package, configure headless server build

#### Build Configuration
⚠️ **Build Scripts**: Existing but need update to 2023 LTS and new scene
- Need: Update build scripts for Unity 2023 LTS and Skirmish_Alpha.unity

### Web3 Changes Required

#### Chain Abstraction
❌ **Chain Service Interface**: No abstraction layer exists
- Need: Implement `IChainService` interface with mock implementation

#### Web3 Disabling
⚠️ **Web3 Integration**: Currently enabled in GameManager
- Need: Disable Web3 features for fun-first alpha (set `IsWeb3Enabled = false`)

## Summary of Required Changes

1. **Create Skirmish Scene** (`Assets/Scenes/Skirmish_Alpha.unity`)
2. **Implement Missing Building Types**: Harvester, Barracks, Wall
3. **Configure Existing Units**: Map to Melee/Ranged requirements
4. **Create AI Enemy Base**: Simple defensive structure for raids
5. **Implement Telemetry System**: Basic HTTP sender or Unity Analytics wrapper
6. **Add Mirror Networking**: Integrate Mirror package and configure server build
7. **Update Build Configuration**: For Unity 2023 LTS and new scene
8. **Disable Web3 Features**: Set `IsWeb3Enabled = false` in GameManager
9. **Implement Chain Abstraction**: Create `IChainService` interface

## Priority Order for Implementation

1. Create Skirmish Scene foundation
2. Implement missing building types (Harvester, Barracks, Wall)
3. Configure existing units for melee/ranged combat
4. Set up basic AI enemy base
5. Implement telemetry system
6. Integrate Mirror networking
7. Update build configuration
8. Disable Web3 features and implement chain abstraction

This GAP REPORT provides a clear roadmap for transforming the existing repository into a fun-first, chain-ready alpha with a playable core loop.
