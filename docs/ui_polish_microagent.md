# UI Polish Microagent for Chain Empires

## Overview
Polish mobile UI for immersion: Touch controls, HUD, menus. Blend with camera/AR for seamless views.

## Key Features
- **HUD Elements**: Resource dashboard, minimap with fog, action queues (timers for buildings/units).
- **Touch Opts**: Drag-select units, pinch-zoom (link to ThirdPersonStrategyCamera), gesture commands.
- **Innovations**: Adaptive HUD (hides idle, expands in combat with Diablo skill bar); narrative popups (branching choices with art); NFT cosmetics (custom themes/skins loaded on-chain).
- **AR UI**: Overlays for real-world scans (e.g., buff icons on detected objects).
- **Implementation in UIManager.cs**: Use Canvas panels, EventSystem for touch; integrate with all managers.

Autonomy Tip: Test on Device Simulator for 60FPS; expand with polls for community UI votes.
